#Introduction
The main idea of  the topic is to help the people who are in need of organs or the people who wants to denote their organs for the sake to help society. By this idea we have made our project on Organ Donation , DOSA (Donate organ and save active life).This website is made from the idea that organ transplantation is the only option to save lives in patients affected by organs failure and improve their quality of living their life as the number of patients are more as compared to the people who donate organs for someone’s better life. This website will provide  a platform to the people who wants to denotes organs and also help for the people for are in need of organs. In this the donor have to register first ,after that he has to fill all the details about him and the organs he wants to donate .After accepting all the policy he will be able to donate the organs. This website may be one option to sustain someone’s life. This website is going to help the decrease the death rate all over the India. Organizations or hospitals who are in need  contact the donor easily when they required. The Google map is also attached  with the address so that the nearest hospital or organization contact which will  take much less time, so  they can save someone’s life.  








                #   Idea behind this project
One organ or tissue donor can help transform the lives of more than 10 people. Organ donation provides a life-giving, life-enhancing opportunity to those who are at the end of the line of hope .Keeping the theme  “Health and Care” in the mind ,We have  created our webpage on the  topic which is “Organ donation” ,  DOSA  (Donate organ and save  active life  is a website where a donor who wants to donate his organs to help the society can upload the information about him and the organs he wants to donate. This website is useful for the people from the view point of saving people’s life as both the people who wants to donate and the one who are in  need of  the organs. The idea to make this website is that organ waiting list is always long .everyday about 107,000 people on the waiting list nationally for organ. People are dying while waiting for an organ . It is easier to transplant organs if the donor and recipient are a good match. By signing in the website you will be a part if the website and daily the website will be updated with the organs the people want to donate and this may help the government of India for easy availability of organs . This may also take less to arrange the organs for patients. The donor after signing in can fill the form of donation . The form will  contain all the information. The nearest hospital or organization will contact the donor as the map is also available in the website .The basic idea of the this website to help the people who are seriously in need ,this may help to somehow decrease the death rate as about 7 lakh	 people annually die due to unavailability of organs on right time . To save the life of thousands of people , we have our website “DOSA” under the theme Health and Care. Organizations may contact directly to the donor .

Future Scope

With the help of backend of this website we can add information about donors and the people who are in need. In this information of the donor is added and then it can be recommended to the other’s who are in need or with whom the match is found. This can be used for blood donation, organ donation or tissue donation. This website is going to help many hospitals and organizations to save people’s life who are in need of organs or tissues. This website is going to decrease the recipient’s waiting times.
